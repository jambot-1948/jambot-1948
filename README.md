# Jamil Jadallah

I run **[The Jambot](https://jambot-1948.github.io/thejambot/)** — a strategic advisory practice based in Austin, TX — and I co-founded **[Beyond The Alignment](https://beyondthealignment.com)** with my friend Robert Amanfu.

My work is about one thing: the gap between what organizations *intend* to build and what they *actually* build. I call that gap **Linguistic Debt** — the semantic distance between business intent and engineering execution. We hold [US Patent 12,106,240 B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12106240B2) for measuring it.

## What I Do

I help executive teams see what their dashboards can't show them.

- **Product operating model design** — building the organizational machinery that turns intent into execution
- **Technical debt quantification** — measuring organizational friction so you can argue with data instead of feelings
- **Product organization buildout** — standing up product functions from scratch in engineering-led companies
- **Strategic risk assessment** — identifying where semantic drift, collaboration fragility, and maintenance burden will hit before they do
